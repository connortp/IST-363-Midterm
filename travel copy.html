                    <h3>This past summer I went on a one week trip to Alaska.</h3>
                    <p>I was visiting family that lives in Alaska that I had not seen in almost five years. I had always been busy with either school or summer camp to visit them so it was finally time that I went up north. The rest of my family had been able to visit them two summers ago but I had been away at camp, so a week by myself was well earned.</p>

                    <h3>Last summer I went on a two week trip to Spain to visit my roommate.</h3>
                    <p>Having an internation roommate does have its perks. I had always hosted him for Thanksgiving and Easter, and now this summer he was repaying the favor by inviting me to spend two week in Spain. We started with one week down on the southern coast of Spain in the city of Cad√≠z, and after that we went back to his apartment in Madrid for the final week. It was a once in a lifetime experience, getting the behind the scenes tour of Spain that most tourists don't have the chance to get.</p>
